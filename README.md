# Arrow-keys-under-IJKL

This AutoHotKey (AHK) script enhances keyboard navigation by mapping keys to arrow keys and other useful functions. It provides both QWERTY and Colemak keybindings for improved text editing and navigation.

## QWERTY Layout
To use QUERTY Layout use **arrows.ahk** file.
The script adds the following key mappings in the QWERTY layout:

- Arrow keys: Mapped to ALT + I / J / K / L
- Page Up: Mapped to ALT + U
- Page Down: Mapped to ALT + O
- Delete: Mapped to ALT + P
- Home: Mapped to ALT + H
- End: Mapped to ALT + ";"

To use these keybindings, simply run the AHK script.

**Note**: These keys also work with Ctrl and Shift modifiers for additional functionality.

## Colemak Layout

If you are using the Colemak keyboard layout, use **arrows-colemak.ahk" file. The keybindings are the same as the QWERTY layout with the same additional functionality with Ctrl and Shift modifiers.

For both layouts, this script offers an efficient way to navigate and edit text using familiar key combinations. Feel free to customize it further to suit your preferences.

For more information on AHK syntax and hotkeys, refer to the [AutoHotKey Documentation](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm).
