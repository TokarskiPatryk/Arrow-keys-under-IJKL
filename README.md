# :computer: Arrow-keys-under-IJKL

This AutoHotKey (AHK) script supercharges your keyboard navigation! ðŸš€ It cleverly maps keys to arrow keys and offers other handy functions. Plus, it supports both QWERTY and Colemak layouts for a personalized experience.

## QWERTY Layout
**For QWERTY Layout, use the `arrows.ahk` file.** ðŸ“‚

The script adds the following key mappings in the QWERTY layout:

- :arrow_up: Arrow keys: Mapped to ALT + I / J / K / L
- :arrow_up_small: Page Up: Mapped to ALT + U
- :arrow_down_small: Page Down: Mapped to ALT + O
- :wastebasket: Delete: Mapped to ALT + P
- :house: Home: Mapped to ALT + H
- :end: End: Mapped to ALT + ";"

To activate these keybindings, simply run the AHK script. âœ¨

**Note**: You can also use Ctrl and Shift modifiers with these keys for even more functionality.

## Colemak Layout
**For Colemak, use the `arrows.ahk` file.** ðŸ“‚
The keybindings are the same as the QWERTY layout with the same additional functionality with Ctrl and Shift modifiers.

For both layouts, this script offers an efficient way to navigate and edit text using familiar key combinations. Feel free to customize it further to suit your preferences.

For more information on AHK syntax and hotkeys, refer to the [AutoHotKey Documentation](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm).
